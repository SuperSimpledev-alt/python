yellow = 5 
#so here we dont want to make variable name yellow which equals to 5. which does not really make any sense.

#Give your Variable names that means Something so that when you see it you know what it is reffering to.

#Example
age = 6 #reffering to age. 
print(age)

age_of_customer = 32 #good
print(age_of_customer)

#age-3 = 3 #not good.
#print(age-3)

#4age = 4 #Cannot start a varibale name with a number.

#Age = 1 #This would work but we do not use capital letters in varibales.
#print(Age)

#return = 5 #can not use Keywords
#print(return)

#remove the comments one by one and see what results you get.
