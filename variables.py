#variables?

# something where we can store the value in!
# we need to come up with some cool name for, you know, we cant just use any name.

age = 5 #storing the number 5 into the varibale named age

print(age) # printing the age would give us the result 5.

#The first benifit of variable that it prevents us from changing the code from quadtrillions of places and also reduces the bugs and mistakes.

# Anoter thing we do with variables is we can use them inside of expressions just like you would in normal number

#example
print(age + 10)
